SIGUR RÓS PRESENTS LIMINAL SLEEP
OUT NOW

“we like the fact that sleep remains defiantly mysterious; something we all do – all need to do – but can’t ever get fully inside. this playlist is a modest attempt to mirror the journey of a sleep cycle, with its curves, steady states and natural transitions.” — jónsi, paul corley & alex somers

=====

to mark the 10th anniversary and first-ever live performances of riceboy sleeps with orchestra and choir, jónsi & alex somers are releasing a new analogue remastered version of their seminal 2009 ambient work. the remastering has been overseen by the artists themselves, in what they see as the definitive pressing of the record.
